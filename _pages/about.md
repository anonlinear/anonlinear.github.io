I am currently a data scientist with Amazon Web Services (AWS). I received my PhD in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University in May 2019. I was advised by Prof. Suman Chakravorty at the [estimation, decision and planning lab](http://edplab.org/people/). My research is in the areas of Statistical Signal Processing, Sensor Tasking and Machine Learning.

Other Names
-----------
My full name is Dilshad Raihan Akkam Veettil. It's been known to spill past space limits in various forms and cause headache to HR departments. As a result, it's often shortened as Dilshad R Akkam Veettil, Dilshad Veettil, Dilshad Raihan, Dilshad Raihan A.V,  etc. I prefer the last one.
